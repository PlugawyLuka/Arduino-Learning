**Status:** üü° PENDING ‚Äî Awaiting hardware delivery  
**Category:** Arduino  
**Added:** 20.10.25  
**Last Updated:** 26.10.25

## Quick Status

**Current Phase:** Phase 0 ‚Äî Hardware acquisition  
**Blocker:** 4x4 keypad hardware on order  
**Next Action:** Unbox and test keypad when delivered

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Learn matrix scanning technique to read 16 buttons using only 8 Arduino pins.

**Key Concept:** Matrix scanning (row/column addressing) ‚Äî same technique used in keyboards, calculators, and keypad systems worldwide.

**Hardware:**
- 4x4 matrix keypad (16 buttons: 0-9, A-D, *, #)
- Arduino Uno
- 8 digital pins (4 rows + 4 columns)

## Goals & Progress

### Phase 0: Hardware Acquisition üü°
- ‚è≥ Order 4x4 keypad online
- ‚è≥ Wait for delivery
- ‚è≥ Unbox and inspect hardware

### Phase 1: Basic Matrix Scanning (Not Started)
- ‚è≥ Understand row/column matrix concept
- ‚è≥ Wire 4x4 keypad to Arduino (8 pins total)
- ‚è≥ Implement basic scanning algorithm (row HIGH, read columns)
- ‚è≥ Serial monitor output: Display which key is pressed
- ‚è≥ Test all 16 keys for correct detection

**Learning Goals:**
- Digital I/O pin switching (OUTPUT ‚Üí INPUT)
- Pull-up/pull-down resistor concepts
- Debouncing for keypad input
- Matrix addressing (row √ó column = button ID)

### Phase 2: Practical Applications (Future)
- ‚è≥ Build simple calculator (0-9, +, -, *, =)
- ‚è≥ Create PIN code entry system (security application)
- ‚è≥ Menu navigation system (A/B/C/D = menu options)
- ‚è≥ Password door lock project

**Advanced Goals:**
- Multi-key detection (can keypad detect 2+ keys simultaneously?)
- Long press vs short press differentiation
- Custom key mapping (assign functions to each key)

## Current Blockers

1. **HARDWARE:** 4x4 keypad on order, not yet delivered
   - **Impact:** Cannot start Phase 1 until hardware arrives
   - **Resolution:** Wait for delivery, track package

## Technical Summary

### Matrix Scanning Principle
A 4x4 matrix keypad has 16 buttons but only needs 8 wires (4 rows + 4 columns):

```
    C1  C2  C3  C4
R1  1   2   3   A
R2  4   5   6   B
R3  7   8   9   C
R4  *   0   #   D
```

**Scanning Algorithm:**
1. Set all row pins to OUTPUT LOW
2. Set one row HIGH (e.g., R1)
3. Read all column pins (INPUT with pull-down)
4. If column reads HIGH ‚Üí button at (row, column) is pressed
5. Repeat for R2, R3, R4
6. Complete scan ~1000 times/second

**Why This Works:**
- Each button connects one row to one column
- When button pressed: current flows from row ‚Üí button ‚Üí column
- By scanning rows sequentially, we detect which (row, column) pair is active
- 16 buttons √ó 1 scan = 8 pin reads (very efficient!)

## Concepts to Learn

**Before Starting:**
- Digital I/O basics (pinMode OUTPUT/INPUT)
- Pull-up resistor concept (avoid floating pins)
- Serial communication (display key presses)

**During Project:**
- Matrix addressing (2D array concept)
- Pin multiplexing (switching pin modes dynamically)
- Debouncing (clean button press detection)
- Scanning loops (efficient polling)

**After Completion:**
- State machines (track input sequences)
- Event-driven programming (key press events)
- User interface design (feedback, timeouts)
