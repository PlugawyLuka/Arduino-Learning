# Arduino Findings — Fundamental Concepts Library

**Purpose:** Cross-project knowledge base for reusable Arduino concepts

**Created:** 20.10.25  
**Last Updated:** 20.10.25

## What Are Findings?

**Findings** are standalone guides documenting fundamental concepts that apply across multiple Arduino projects. Unlike project-specific READMEs, Findings capture universal principles you can reference again and again.

**Think of Findings as:**
- 📚 Personal Arduino textbook (written by you, for you)
- 🔗 Reusable knowledge blocks
- 🎯 Quick reference guides
- 🧠 Extracted wisdom from hands-on experience

---

## What Belongs in Findings?

### ✅ **Good Candidates for Findings:**

**Fundamental concepts:**
- Voltage dividers
- Current limiting
- Pull-up/pull-down resistors
- PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
- Analog vs Digital signals

**Common patterns:**
- Button debouncing
- Edge detection
- Non-blocking code (millis())
- Matrix scanning
- State machines

**Circuit techniques:**
- Resistor selection formulas
- LED brightness control
- Sensor interfacing
- Power management

**Programming patterns:**

---

### ❌ **Don't Create Findings For:**

**Project-specific details:**
- "How I wired my specific photoresistor circuit"
- "Calibration values for my particular sensor"
- "Pin assignments for my LED display"

**One-time solutions:**
- Troubleshooting a specific wiring mistake
- Fixing a particular compilation error
- Hardware-specific quirks

**Too basic/obvious:**
- "How to connect USB cable"
- "How to open Arduino IDE"
- "What is a breadboard"

**Too advanced/rare:**
- Concepts you'll likely never use again
- Highly specialized techniques
- Hardware you don't own

---

## How to Use Findings

### **When Starting a Project:**
1. Check if relevant Findings exist
2. Reference them in project README ("Concepts Used" section)
3. Build on existing knowledge instead of relearning

**Example:**
```markdown
## Concepts Used in My Thermistor Project
- [Voltage Dividers](../Findings/Voltage-Divider.md) — Converting resistance to voltage
- [Analog Input](../Findings/Analog-Input.md) — Reading temperature values
```

---

### **When Learning Something New:**
1. Work through project hands-on
2. Discover fundamental concept
3. Ask: "Will I use this in other projects?"
4. If yes → Create Finding guide
5. Link Finding in session log and project README

**Example workflow:**
```
Photoresistor project → Discover voltage dividers → Create Voltage-Divider.md
Thermistor project → "Oh, voltage dividers again!" → Reference existing Finding
Battery monitor → Same concept, new application → Link to Finding
```

---

### **When Stuck on a Problem:**
1. Check Findings for relevant concepts
2. Review examples and explanations
3. Apply knowledge to your specific case
4. Update Finding if you discover new insights

---

**What it is:** Circuit technique for converting resistance to voltage  
**Why it matters:** Essential for resistive sensors (photoresistor, thermistor, potentiometer)  
**Used in:** Photoresistor project  
**Created:** 20.10.25 (Session: `Logs/2025/Oct/20.10.md`)

**Key concepts:**
- Two resistors in series create voltage division
- V_out = V_in × (R2 / (R1 + R2))
- Required for converting sensor resistance to measurable voltage
- Critical for analog sensors with Arduino

---

#### **2. [Current Limiting](Current-Limiting.md)** ✅
**What it is:** Using resistors to protect LEDs and Arduino pins  
**Why it matters:** Prevents component damage, controls LED brightness  
**Used in:** 10LEDs-level, 10resistors, Potentiometer  
**Created:** 20.10.25 (Sessions: 19.10.25, 07-08.10.25)

**Key concepts:**
- Every LED needs current-limiting resistor
- Standard value: 220Ω for 5V Arduino
- Formula: R = (V_supply - V_led) / I_desired
- Arduino pin limit: 20mA recommended, 40mA absolute max
- Real discovery: Pin 12 drew 29.4mA without resistor (unsafe)

---

#### **3. [Button Debouncing](ButtonDebouncing.md)** ✅
**What it is:** Handling mechanical switch bounce for reliable input  
**Why it matters:** Prevents false triggers and multiple readings  
**Used in:** 10resistors, all button projects  
**Created:** [Earlier session]

**Key concepts:**
- Mechanical buttons "bounce" (vibrate on contact)
- Simple solution: 50ms delay after detection
- Advanced: Capacitor hardware debounce
- Essential for any button/switch interface

---

#### **4. [Non-Blocking Code](Non-Blocking-Code.md)** ✅
**What it is:** Using millis() instead of delay() for responsive programs  
**Why it matters:** Allows multiple tasks to run "simultaneously"  
**Used in:** 10resistors (voltage monitoring)  
**Created:** 20.10.25 (Session: 08.10.25)

**Key concepts:**
- delay() blocks entire program (can't do anything else)
- millis() returns time since startup (doesn't block)
- Pattern: Check if enough time elapsed, then act
- Multiple independent timers possible
- Real problem: delay(1000) made button unresponsive

---

#### **5. [Edge Detection](Edge-Detection.md)** ✅
**What it is:** Detecting state transitions (LOW→HIGH or HIGH→LOW)  
**Why it matters:** Trigger actions once per event, not continuously  
**Used in:** 10resistors (button cycling)  
**Created:** 20.10.25 (Sessions: 07-08.10.25)

**Key concepts:**
- Rising edge: LOW → HIGH (button pressed)
- Falling edge: HIGH → LOW (button released)
- Pattern: Compare current vs. previous state
- Essential for toggles, counters, mode switching
- Real application: One button press = one LED change (not continuous)
