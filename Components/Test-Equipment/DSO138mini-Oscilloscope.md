## Arduino Integration & Applications

### Perfect for Your Projects!

#### **Phase 2: Photoresistor PWM Analysis** ⭐
```cpp
// Connect oscilloscope to PWM pin to see actual waveform
int ledPin = 9;  // Connect DSO138mini probe here

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Generate different PWM values
  analogWrite(ledPin, 64);   // 25% duty cycle
  delay(2000);
  analogWrite(ledPin, 128);  // 50% duty cycle  
  delay(2000);
  analogWrite(ledPin, 192);  // 75% duty cycle
  delay(2000);
}
```

**What you'll see:**
```
25% duty cycle: ┐    ┐    ┐    ┐
               ─┘────┘────┘────┘────

50% duty cycle: ┐──┐ ┐──┐ ┐──┐ ┐──┐
               ─┘  └─┘  └─┘  └─┘  └─

75% duty cycle: ┐────┐┐────┐┐────┐┐
               ─┘    └┘    └┘    └┘
```

**Measurements to take:**
- **Frequency:** ~490Hz (Arduino Uno PWM default)
- **Duty cycle:** Verify actual % matches analogWrite() value
- **Voltage levels:** 0V (LOW) to 5V (HIGH)
- **Rise/fall times:** How fast transitions occur

#### **Voltage Divider Analysis**
```cpp
// Analyze your photoresistor voltage divider output
// Connect probe to A0 connection point

int sensorPin = A0;  // Connect DSO138mini here too

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int reading = analogRead(sensorPin);
  Serial.println(reading);
  delay(100);
}
```

**What you'll observe:**
- **DC voltage levels** changing with light
- **Noise** on the analog signal (real-world effects!)
- **Response time** when light changes
- **Voltage range** your sensor actually uses

#### **Digital Signal Analysis**
```cpp
// Examine digital pin output characteristics
int digitalPin = 8;

void setup() {
  pinMode(digitalPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(digitalPin, HIGH);
  delay(1);
  digitalWrite(digitalPin, LOW);
  delay(1);
}
```

**Measurements:**
- **Rise time:** How fast pin goes 0V → 5V
- **Fall time:** How fast pin goes 5V → 0V  
- **Voltage levels:** Actual HIGH/LOW voltages
- **Timing accuracy:** Are delays actually 1ms?

## Measurement Procedures

### Basic Voltage Measurement
```
1. Connect probe to signal source
2. Set appropriate V/div scale (signal should fit on screen)
3. Adjust trigger level if needed
4. Read voltage from grid divisions
5. Voltage = (divisions from center) × (V/div setting)

Example:
Signal peak is 2.5 divisions above center line
V/div set to 1V
Peak voltage = 2.5 × 1V = 2.5V
```

### Frequency Measurement
```
1. Set time base so you see 2-3 complete cycles
2. Measure time for one complete cycle (period)
3. Frequency = 1 / Period

Example:
One cycle takes 4 divisions horizontally
Time/div set to 500μs
Period = 4 × 500μs = 2ms = 0.002s
Frequency = 1 / 0.002s = 500Hz
```

### PWM Duty Cycle Measurement
```
1. Capture stable PWM waveform
2. Measure total period (T)
3. Measure HIGH time (t_high)
4. Duty cycle = (t_high / T) × 100%

Example:
Total period = 8 divisions = 8 × 250μs = 2ms
HIGH time = 2 divisions = 2 × 250μs = 0.5ms
Duty cycle = (0.5ms / 2ms) × 100% = 25%
```

---

## Calibration & Setup

### Initial Calibration (Important!)
```
1. Power on oscilloscope
2. Let warm up for 5-10 minutes
3. Access calibration menu (check manual)
4. Follow calibration procedure:
   - DC offset calibration
   - Gain calibration  
   - Frequency calibration
5. Save calibration settings
```

### Probe Compensation
```
1. Most DSO138mini kits include calibration signal
2. Connect probe to CAL output (usually ~1kHz square wave)
3. Adjust probe compensation screw (if adjustable probe)
4. Square wave should have flat tops and bottoms
5. If overshoot/undershoot, adjust probe compensation

Proper compensation:     Poor compensation:
┐───┐───┐───┐───        ┐╱╲╱┐╱╲╱┐╱╲╱┐  (overshoot)
└───┘───┘───┘───   or   └╲_╱└╲_╱└╲_╱└  (undershoot)
```

### Common Settings for Arduino Work
```
Voltage Range:    1V/div (most Arduino signals 0-5V)
Time Base:        1ms/div (good starting point)
Trigger:          Auto (for continuous signals)
                 Normal (for one-shot events)
Coupling:         DC (to see actual voltage levels)
                 AC (to remove DC offset, see variations)
```
