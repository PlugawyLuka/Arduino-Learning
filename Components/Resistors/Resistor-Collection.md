## Resistor Theory & Applications

### Ohm's Law Fundamentals
```
V = I × R (Voltage = Current × Resistance)
I = V / R (Current = Voltage / Resistance)  
R = V / I (Resistance = Voltage / Current)
P = V × I = I²R = V²/R (Power calculations)

Key Relationships:
- Higher resistance = Lower current (for same voltage)
- Series resistors: R_total = R1 + R2 + R3...
- Parallel resistors: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3...
```

### Voltage Divider Calculations
```
Formula: V_out = V_in × (R2 / (R1 + R2))

Example with photoresistor:
V_in = 5V, R1 = photoresistor (variable), R2 = 10kΩ (fixed)

Bright light (R1 = 1kΩ):
V_out = 5V × (10kΩ / (1kΩ + 10kΩ)) = 5V × 0.909 = 4.545V

Dark (R1 = 100kΩ):  
V_out = 5V × (10kΩ / (100kΩ + 10kΩ)) = 5V × 0.091 = 0.455V
```

### Current Limiting for LEDs
```
Formula: R = (V_supply - V_led) / I_desired

Standard Red LED: V_forward = 2.0V, I_max = 20mA
Arduino 5V supply: R = (5V - 2V) / 0.02A = 150Ω
Closest standard value: 220Ω (conservative, safe choice)

Actual current with 220Ω: I = (5V - 2V) / 220Ω = 13.6mA (safe)

Different LED colors:
Red LED (2.0V):    220Ω resistor → 13.6mA
Green LED (2.2V):  220Ω resistor → 12.7mA  
Blue LED (3.2V):   220Ω resistor → 8.2mA
White LED (3.2V):  220Ω resistor → 8.2mA
```

## Power Rating & Safety

### 1/4 Watt (0.25W) Standard Rating
```
Maximum Power: P = V²/R = I²R

Safety Examples:
47Ω at 5V:    P = 5²/47 = 0.53W (EXCEEDS 1/4W rating!)
100Ω at 5V:   P = 5²/100 = 0.25W (At maximum rating)
220Ω at 5V:   P = 5²/220 = 0.11W (Safe, well within rating)
10kΩ at 5V:   P = 5²/10000 = 0.0025W (Very safe)

Rule: Keep power dissipation below 80% of rating for reliability
Safe maximum: 0.25W × 0.8 = 0.2W
```

### Current Calculations for Safety
```
Maximum safe current (0.2W limit):
47Ω:    I = √(0.2W/47Ω) = 65mA
100Ω:   I = √(0.2W/100Ω) = 45mA  
220Ω:   I = √(0.2W/220Ω) = 30mA
10kΩ:   I = √(0.2W/10kΩ) = 4.5mA

Arduino pin maximum: 20mA
Always use appropriate resistor values!
```

### Heat Dissipation Guidelines
```
Normal operation: Resistor barely warm to touch
Warm operation: May be acceptable for short periods
Hot operation: Reduce current or use higher wattage resistor

Visual indicators:
✅ Normal: Original colors, no discoloration
⚠️ Stressed: Slight darkening around body  
❌ Damaged: Brown/black burn marks, cracked body

### RC Timing Circuits
```cpp
// RC timing for delays and oscillators  
int capacitorPin = A2;  // Connect RC circuit to analog pin
unsigned long chargeTime = 0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void measureRCTime() {
  pinMode(capacitorPin, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(capacitorPin, LOW);  // Discharge capacitor
  delay(1);
  
  pinMode(capacitorPin, INPUT);     // Let capacitor charge through resistor
  unsigned long startTime = micros();
  
  while (digitalRead(capacitorPin) == LOW) {
    // Wait for capacitor to charge to logic HIGH threshold
  }
  
  chargeTime = micros() - startTime;
}

void loop() {
  measureRCTime();
  
  Serial.print("RC charge time: ");
  Serial.print(chargeTime);
  Serial.println(" microseconds");
  
  delay(1000);
}
```

### Current Sensing Applications
```cpp
// Shunt resistor current measurement
int shuntPin = A3;        // Voltage across shunt resistor
float shuntResistance = 0.1;  // 0.1Ω shunt (100mΩ)
float current = 0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Read voltage across shunt resistor
  int reading = analogRead(shuntPin);
  float voltage = reading * (5.0 / 1023.0);
  
  // Calculate current using Ohm's law: I = V / R
  current = voltage / shuntResistance;
  
  Serial.print("Current: ");
  Serial.print(current * 1000);  // Display in mA
  Serial.println(" mA");
  
  delay(500);
}
```
